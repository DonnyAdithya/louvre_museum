    <foaf:title>Museum Louvre</foaf:title>
    <foaf:carousel1>The Louvre is the world’s most famous and largest fine arts museum. It’s home to the one of the most impressive art collections in history. It’s also the most visited museum of the world with a stonking 10 million visitors a year – but it wasn’t always this way.</foaf:carousel1>
    <foaf:carousel2>The Louvre was originally built as a fortress in the late 12th century. By the 14th century it had become more of a residence for the French royal family. In the 16th century, Francis I, known as the French Renaissance King, had major works carried out to turn it into a Renaissance palace.</foaf:carousel2>
    <foaf:carousel3>The world’s most visited fine arts museum was once a fortress.  The history of the Louvre Museum is fascinating. So enormous is the Louvre, that it would take three months to view every piece of art contained in it. And that’s if you spent just 30 seconds looking at each artwork all day, every day without a break.</foaf:carousel3>
